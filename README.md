# GitHub Profile View Bot
This is a Python script for simulating views on a GitHub profile. It uses HTTP requests to access a GitHub profile and retrieves the view count displayed on the profile. The script utilizes the httpx library for making HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for parsing the HTML content of the GitHub profile page.

# Prerequisites
Before you can use this script, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

httpx library (install it using pip install httpx)

BeautifulSoup library (install it using pip install beautifulsoup4)

# Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open the Python script github_view_bot.py.

You may need to modify the following variables in the script:

url: This is simply the URL for your profile views

Inside the main() function, you can modify the range integer to specify the number of views you want to simulate. The script will use multiprocessing to speed up the process.

Run the script:

`python github_view_bot.py`
The script will start making requests to the specified GitHub profile, and it will print the number of views extracted from the profile page.
